# Certificate
- This is to certify that Aditya Gautam of class XII- M, Amity International School, Mayur Vihar, roll number - 2 has successfully completed a project in computer practical for the AISSCE as prescribed by CBSE in the academic year 2022-23.

# Acknowledgement
- I would like to express my special thanks to my teacher Ms. Deepshika Sethi who gave me the opportunity to do this project and also helped me in doing a lot of Research. I came to know about a lot of new things related to python. Secondly, I would also like to thank my parents who helped me a lot in finalising this project within the limited timeframe.

# Introduction
- Once upon a time, during the early years of the Internet, you may have had a handful of passwords for a few essential web applications that you used to shop, study, stay connected, and get work done. Today, things are much more complicated. A 2017 report from LastPass found, on average, people had to remember 191 different passwords—just for work—not to mention their personal passwords.
- While technology promises to make our lives easier, and it generally does, every new website and application we sign up for is another password we have to remember. For most, it’s become impossible to remember all of them. The 2019 Google Online Security Survey found 52 percent of respondents reused the same password for multiple (but not all) accounts. 
- Using giant lists of stolen passwords (aka “dumps”) bought off the dark web, cybercriminals can brute force their way into other sites or use old passwords to extort users in scams. This is the data breach domino effect. One breach leads to another and another and so on.
- To prevent this, I devised an idea, fruition of which is the app that you are seeing. A locally storing safe and secure password manager.
- There are several benefits of using this password manager: 
    1. You don’t have to memorise all your passwords anymore.
    2. It can auto-generate highly secure passwords for you.
    3. Password managers save time.
    4. They help protect your identity.
